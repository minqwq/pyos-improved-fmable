The Improved version added too much programs and it's maybe better than MPGA.
Type "help" to show them.

We also support external program, type "extprog" to run:

 - "__exit__":  Exit extprog
 - Else:        start program name

And we hope you try the original PY OS
It's rebirth on Jul 15 2024
